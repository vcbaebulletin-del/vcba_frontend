🎯 Reaction System Fixes Applied:

✅ Fixed Issues:
1. Missing reaction functions in useAnnouncements hook
2. State not updating after API calls (now uses optimistic updates)
3. Comment reaction logic errors (fixed count calculation)
4. Both student and admin newsfeeds now use proper hooks

🔧 Changes Made:
- Added likeAnnouncement & unlikeAnnouncement to useAnnouncements hook
- Updated both newsfeeds to use hooks instead of manual API calls
- Fixed comment reaction count logic in useComments hook
- Implemented optimistic UI updates for better user experience

🧪 Expected Behavior Now:
- Reaction buttons should turn red immediately when clicked
- Reaction counts should update instantly
- No more "already red but count is zero" bugs
- Proper state management across the application

🎯 Test the fixes by:
1. Login as student or admin
2. Click reaction buttons on posts and comments
3. Verify buttons turn red/gray correctly
4. Verify counts update properly
5. Refresh page and verify state persists
