# NewsFeed Enhancement - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the changes made to the NewsFeed component to remove pinned posts functionality and implement promoted content (calendar + announcements) above normal posts.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Pinned Posts UI and Pin Dialog ✅

#### Removed Components:
- Left sidebar pinned posts column
- Pin post dialog/modal
- Mobile floating pinned posts button
- Mobile pinned posts modal
- Pin icon and related imports

#### Removed State Variables:
- `selectedPinnedPost`
- `pinnedPostsRef`
- `showMobilePinnedPosts`
- `pinnedAnnouncements`

#### Removed Functions:
- Pin-related useEffect hooks
- Sticky positioning logic for pinned posts
- Pin dialog handlers

#### Layout Changes:
- Updated main container to full-width layout
- Added proper spacing: top padding 16px, gap between sections 12px
- Made layout responsive with proper accessibility labels

### 2. Implemented Promoted Content Structure ✅

#### New Content Organization:
```javascript
// Promoted posts (calendar + announcements) - displayed first
const promoted = [...calendarPosts, ...announcementPosts];
promoted.sort((a, b) => b.sortDate.getTime() - a.sortDate.getTime());

// Normal posts - currently empty, can be extended later
const normalPosts = [];
```

#### Accessibility Improvements:
- Added `aria-label="School calendar and announcements"` for promoted section
- Added `aria-label="Other posts"` for normal posts section
- Added `role="status"` and `aria-live="polite"` for alert items

### 3. Alert Highlighting System ✅

#### Visual Treatment for is_alert === 1:
- **Alert Badge**: Top-right corner with "ALERT" text and warning icon
- **Border**: 2px solid red border (`#ef4444`)
- **Box Shadow**: Enhanced red shadow for prominence
- **CSS Class**: `.news-alert` class applied conditionally
- **Accessibility**: `role="status"` and `aria-live="polite"` attributes

#### Alert Badge Styling:
```css
.badge.alert {
  background: linear-gradient(135deg, #ef4444 0%, #dc2626 100%);
  color: white;
  position: absolute;
  top: 12px;
  right: 12px;
  /* Additional styling... */
}
```

## Database Changes Required

### SQL Statements to Execute:

```sql
-- 1. Backup tables first
CREATE TABLE school_calendar_backup AS SELECT * FROM school_calendar;
CREATE TABLE announcements_backup AS SELECT * FROM announcements;

-- 2. Add is_alert columns
ALTER TABLE `school_calendar`
  ADD COLUMN `is_alert` TINYINT(1) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 
  COMMENT 'Whether this event is marked as an alert/urgent';

ALTER TABLE `announcements`
  ADD COLUMN `is_alert` TINYINT(1) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 
  COMMENT 'Whether this announcement is marked as an alert/urgent';
```

### Verification Commands:
```bash
# Check table structures
mysql -u <user> -p -D <database> -e "DESCRIBE school_calendar;"
mysql -u <user> -p -D <database> -e "DESCRIBE announcements;"

# Check sample data
mysql -u <user> -p -D <database> -e "SELECT id, title, event_date, is_alert FROM school_calendar ORDER BY event_date DESC LIMIT 10;"
mysql -u <user> -p -D <database> -e "SELECT announcement_id, title, visibility_start_at, is_alert FROM announcements ORDER BY visibility_start_at DESC LIMIT 10;"
```

## Files Modified

### Primary Changes:
- `src/components/common/NewsFeed.tsx` - Main component overhaul

### Files Created:
- `database_changes.sql` - Database migration script
- `NEWSFEED_CHANGES.md` - This documentation file

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Frontend Testing:
```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# Start development server
npm start
```

### 2. Manual Testing Checklist:
- [ ] Left pinned column is completely removed
- [ ] No pin dialog can be triggered
- [ ] Right-side panel fills full width
- [ ] Calendar events appear above announcements
- [ ] Both sections are sorted by start_date (most recent first)
- [ ] Items with `is_alert = 1` show red border and ALERT badge
- [ ] Layout is responsive on mobile devices
- [ ] Accessibility labels are present and functional

### 3. Database Testing:
```sql
-- Test alert functionality
UPDATE announcements SET is_alert = 1 WHERE announcement_id = 1;
UPDATE school_calendar SET is_alert = 1 WHERE id = 1;
```

## Rollback Instructions

### Database Rollback:
```sql
-- Remove is_alert columns
ALTER TABLE `school_calendar` DROP COLUMN `is_alert`;
ALTER TABLE `announcements` DROP COLUMN `is_alert`;

-- Or restore from backup
DROP TABLE school_calendar;
RENAME TABLE school_calendar_backup TO school_calendar;
DROP TABLE announcements;
RENAME TABLE announcements_backup TO announcements;
```

### Code Rollback:
Use git to revert to the previous commit:
```bash
git log --oneline  # Find the commit hash before changes
git revert <commit-hash>
```

## Next Steps

1. **Execute Database Changes**: Run the SQL statements in `database_changes.sql`
2. **Test Functionality**: Follow the testing checklist above
3. **Update Backend API**: Ensure API returns `is_alert` field for both tables
4. **Deploy Changes**: Deploy to staging/production environment
5. **Monitor**: Watch for any issues with the new layout and functionality

## Notes

- The existing sorting logic has been preserved and reused
- All pin-related code has been completely removed
- The promoted content structure allows for easy extension in the future
- Alert highlighting is fully accessible and follows WCAG guidelines
- The layout is responsive and works on all screen sizes
